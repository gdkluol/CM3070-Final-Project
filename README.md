# CM3070-Final-Project

## This is the final project for the BSc Computer Science degree.

This is the code that accompanies the final report. The project consisted of detecting fake news with different Machine Learning models as well as Neural Networks. 

Additionally, the project used webscraping to add meta-data to news articles to determine if the addition of meta-data would improve model performance.
